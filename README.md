<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

# About The Project

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a static site generator that helps you ship beautiful, accessible docs. For building our [documentation](https://docs.icmarket.app) portal, we have made certain modifications over the template generated by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) to be able to properly showcase all our SDKs with their respective versions.

We are delighted to see our documentation featured on [Docusaurus Site Showcase](https://docusaurus.io/showcase), and hope you like it!

## Built With

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This section describes how you can get our documentation portal up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NnsDao/icmarketdocs.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

3. Run the app

```sh
npm start
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

<!-- In usage, mention how to edit the docs, how to update versions, etc. -->

### Writing Documentation

To just edit older documentation, go to the specified versioned folder for a section, for example, you want to edit documentation for React SDK v0.25.x, open up [react_versioned_docs/version-0.25.x](./react_versioned_docs/version-0.25.x) and edit the required files there.

To create a new version inside a section, for example, flutter. Make your changes in [docs/flutter](./docs/flutter). The `./docs` folder consists of the `next` version, which is unpublished, and is where you add your newer or _next_ version of documentation.

After your changes are done, to create a version, run the following command:

```sh
npm run docusaurus docs:version:flutter 1.2.3
```

This will create a new version `1.2.3` for flutter.

Reference: <https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning>

### To add new sections

Create a new section in docusaurus by adding a new plugin entry in [docusaurus.config.js](./docusaurus.config.js).

Say you're adding a new Go section:

```js
{
  plugins: [
    // ...
    [
      '@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs',
      {
        path: 'docs/go',
        routeBasePath: 'go',
        id: 'go',
        sidebarPath: require.resolve('./sidebars/sidebars-go.js'),
        sidebarCollapsible: false,
        onlyIncludeVersions: !isDev ? require('./go_versions.json') : undefined,
      },
    ],
  ];
}
```

After you add this, you'll need to create a [sidebars file](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar) `./sidebars/sidebars-go.js`.

Also add your new docs to `./docs/go`, say you add `introduction.mdx`

Now, run `npm start` and you can access your Go docs at <http://localhost:3000/go/introduction>

Then, you can create versions and edit older versions as mentioned above.

### Adding new docs to the Context Switcher

To add a newly created section to the Context Switcher, edit [./src/components/ContextSwitcher.jsx](src/components/ContextSwitcher.jsx).

For example, for a section go, you will add:

```jsx
import { GoIcon } from '../assets/icons';

const CONTEXTS = [
  // ...
  {
    id: 'go',
    name: 'Go',
    icon: GoIcon,
  },
];
```

You'll need to create a GoIcon component too.

That is it!
